About custom perk:<br />
_Receive __Payback__ at the start of __each turn__. Upon killing an enemy, move one stack from self to a random ally; 
that ally has a chance to become __Inspired__. Each stack of __Payback__ slightly increases __Damage__ with a slightly higher __Chance to hit__ until the end of the combat._
